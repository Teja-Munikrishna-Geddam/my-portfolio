          I’m a passionate <strong>Developer</strong> with a growing foundation in <strong>frontend, backend, APIs, and databases</strong>, and I aspire to build my career as a <strong>Full Stack Java Developer</strong>. I enjoy working on end-to-end applications and understanding how different parts of a system connect and function together. I graduated from<strong> SIES Nerul College of Commerce, Arts and Science</strong>, where I not only gained academic knowledge but also built strong <strong>problem-solving skills and a genuine interest in software development</strong>. With hands-on exposure across the full stack, I’m always eager to learn new technologies, adapt quickly, and contribute to meaningful projects while sharpening my technical skills.
